## About Maverick
Maverick is a Laravel-like WordPress theme MVC framework.

Maverick makes the development of WordPress themes surprisingly efficient.
For example, it has a powerful function for easily controlling information on articles.

Adopting Laravel Blade Templates as the rendering engine allows you to write views with very little code.

Maverick is integrated with webpack. Webpack also demonstrates its power for front-end development.
